# 3D Perception Project [![Udacity - Robotics NanoDegree Program](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Extra+Images/RoboND_flag.png)](https://www.udacity.com/robotics)


using pr2 robot which has RGB-D camera to perceive it's surrounding to pick specific object by defining it and place it in another specific place depending on the object itself, by performing analysis on the received data which has noise and distortion, by applying the filtering and segmentation techniques then object recognition  and pose estimation to be able to tell the robot the position and orientation for each object.


## about PR2
The PR2 is one of the most advanced research robots ever built. Its powerful hardware and software systems let it do things like clean up tables, fold towels, and fetch you drinks from the fridge.

## first filtering and segmentation
### 3- pcl_callback() function
this function include filtering, segmentation and object recognition parts
it will be called back every time a message is published to `/pr2/world/points`
#### first by converting the ros message type to pcl data 
```python
def pcl_callback(pcl_msg):

    ##########################################
    # first part :- filtering and segmentation
    ##########################################


    # first by converting the ros message type to pcl data
    cloud_filtered = ros_to_pcl(pcl_msg)
```

### 4- Statistical Outlier Filtering
While calibration takes care of distortion, noise due to external factors like dust in the environment, humidity in the air, or presence of various light sources lead to sparse outliers which corrupt the results even more.

Such outliers lead to complications in the estimation of point cloud characteristics like curvature, gradients, etc. leading to erroneous values, which in turn might cause failures at various stages in our perception pipeline.

One of the filtering techniques used to remove such outliers is to perform a statistical analysis in the neighborhood of each point, and remove those points which do not meet a certain criteria. PCL’s StatisticalOutlierRemoval filter is an example of one such filtering technique. For each point in the point cloud, it computes the distance to all of its neighbors, and then calculates a mean distance.

```python
    # due to external factors like dust in the environment we apply Outlier Removal Filter
    # taking the number of neighboring points = 4 & threshold scale factor = .00001
    outlier_filter = cloud_filtered.make_statistical_outlier_filter()
    outlier_filter.set_mean_k(4)
    x = 0.00001
    outlier_filter.set_std_dev_mul_thresh(x)
    cloud_filtered = outlier_filter.filter()
```

big difference !!


### 5- Voxel Grid Downsampling
RGB-D cameras provide feature rich and particularly dense point clouds, meaning, more points are packed in per unit volume than, for example, a Lidar point cloud. Running computation on a full resolution point cloud can be slow and may not yield any improvement on results obtained using a more sparsely sampled point cloud.

So, in many cases, it is advantageous to downsample the data. In particular, you are going to use a VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter to derive a point cloud that has fewer points but should still do a good job of representing the input point cloud as a whole.
```python
    # using VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter to derive a point cloud that has fewer points
    # Creating a VoxelGrid filter object taking the leaf-size = .01
    vox = cloud_filtered.make_voxel_grid_filter()
    LEAF_SIZE = 0.01
    vox.set_leaf_size(LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE)
    cloud_filtered = vox.filter()
```

#### the cloud after Voxel Grid Downsampling

![try2](https://github.com/mohamedsayedantar/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/images/try3.jpg)
done! : low points per unit volume


### 6- PassThrough Filter 

The Pass Through Filter works much like a cropping tool, which allows you to crop any given 3D point cloud by specifying an axis with cut-off values along that axis. The region you allow to pass through, is often referred to as region of interest.

Applying a Pass Through filter along z axis (the height with respect to the ground) to our tabletop scene in the range 0.61 to 1.1

```python
    passthrough = cloud_filtered.make_passthrough_filter()
    filter_axis = 'z'
    passthrough.set_filter_field_name(filter_axis)
    axis_min = 0.61
    axis_max = 1.1
    passthrough.set_filter_limits(axis_min, axis_max)
    cloud_filtered = passthrough.filter()
```

Applying a Pass Through filter along y axis (for horizontal axis) to our tabletop scene in the range -0.45 to 0.45

```python
    passthrough = cloud_filtered.make_passthrough_filter()
    filter_axis = 'y'
    passthrough.set_filter_field_name(filter_axis)
    axis_min = -0.45
    axis_max = 0.45
    passthrough.set_filter_limits(axis_min, axis_max)
    cloud_filtered = passthrough.filter()
```

#### the cloud after PassThrough Filter

![try2](https://github.com/mohamedsayedantar/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/images/try4.jpg)
done! : the region has been specified


### 7- RANSAC Plane Segmentation

to remove the table itself from the scene. a popular technique known as Random Sample Consensus or "RANSAC". RANSAC is an algorithm, that can be used to identify points in the dataset that belong to a particular model.

The RANSAC algorithm assumes that all of the data in a dataset is composed of both inliers and outliers, where inliers can be defined by a particular model with a specific set of parameters, while outliers do not fit that model and hence can be discarded. Like in the example below, we can extract the outliners that are not good fits for the model.

If there is a prior knowledge of a certain shape being present in a given data set, we can use RANSAC to estimate what pieces of the point cloud set belong to that shape by assuming a particular model.

```python
    # using The RANSAC algorithm to remove the table from the scene
    # by Creating the segmentation object and Setting the model
    # setting the max_distance then extracting the inliers and outliers
    seg = cloud_filtered.make_segmenter()
    seg.set_model_type(pcl.SACMODEL_PLANE)
    seg.set_method_type(pcl.SAC_RANSAC)
    max_distance =0.01
    seg.set_distance_threshold(max_distance)
    inliers, coefficients = seg.segment()

    # Extract inliers and outliers
    extracted_table = cloud_filtered.extract(inliers, negative=False)
    extracted_objects = cloud_filtered.extract(inliers, negative=True)
```

![try2](https://github.com/mohamedsayedantar/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/images/try5'.jpg)
done! : object and table have been extracted


### 8- Euclidean Clustering "DBSCAN Algorithm"

DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. 

The DBSCAN algorithm creates clusters by grouping data points that are within some threshold distance from the nearest other point in the data.

The DBSCAN Algorithm is sometimes also called “Euclidean Clustering”, because the decision of whether to place a point in a particular cluster is based upon the “Euclidean distance” between that point and other cluster members.

```python
    # using a PCL library to perform a DBSCAN cluster search
    # first convert XYZRGB to XYZ then Create a cluster extraction object
    # then by Settin the tolerances for distance threshold, minimum and maximum cluster size
    # then Search the k-d tree for clusters and Extract indices for each of the discovered clusters
    white_cloud = XYZRGB_to_XYZ(extracted_objects)
    tree = white_cloud.make_kdtree()
    ec = white_cloud.make_EuclideanClusterExtraction()
    ec.set_ClusterTolerance(0.015)
    ec.set_MinClusterSize(1)
    ec.set_MaxClusterSize(50000)
    ec.set_SearchMethod(tree)
    cluster_indices = ec.Extract()
```

visualize the results in RViz! by creating another point cloud of type PointCloud_PointXYZRGB.

```python
    # final step is to visualize the results in RViz!
    # by creating another point cloud of type PointCloud_PointXYZRGB
    cluster_color = get_color_list(len(cluster_indices))
    color_cluster_point_list = []
    for j, indices in enumerate(cluster_indices):
        for i, indice in enumerate(indices):
            color_cluster_point_list.append([white_cloud[indice][0],
                                            white_cloud[indice][1],
                                            white_cloud[indice][2],
                                             rgb_to_float(cluster_color[j])])
    cluster_cloud = pcl.PointCloud_PointXYZRGB()
    cluster_cloud.from_list(color_cluster_point_list)
```

    ros_cloud_objects = pcl_to_ros(extracted_objects)
    ros_cloud_table = pcl_to_ros(extracted_table)
```
### Publish the ROS messages

```python
    pcl_objects_pub.publish(ros_cloud_objects)
    pcl_table_pub.publish(ros_cloud_table)
    pcl_cluster_pub.publish(ros_cluster_cloud)
```

For this setup, catkin_ws is the name of active ROS Workspace, if your workspace name is different, change the commands accordingly
If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

Now that you have a workspace, clone or download this repo into the src directory of your workspace:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project.git
```
### Note: If you have the Kinematics Pick and Place project in the same ROS Workspace as this project, please remove the 'gazebo_grasp_plugin' directory from the `RoboND-Perception-Project/` directory otherwise ignore this note. 

Now install missing dependencies using rosdep install:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
```
Build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```
Add following to your .bashrc file
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
```

If you haven’t already, following line can be added to your .bashrc to auto-source all new terminals
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

To run the demo:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/scripts
$ chmod u+x pr2_safe_spawner.sh
$ ./pr2_safe_spawner.sh
```
![demo-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20687560/28748231-46b5b912-7467-11e7-8778-3095172b7b19.png)



Once Gazebo is up and running, make sure you see following in the gazebo world:
- Robot

- Table arrangement

- Three target objects on the table

- Dropboxes on either sides of the robot


If any of these items are missing, please report as an issue on [the waffle board](https://waffle.io/udacity/robotics-nanodegree-issues).

In your RViz window, you should see the robot and a partial collision map displayed:

![demo-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20687560/28748286-9f65680e-7468-11e7-83dc-f1a32380b89c.png)

Proceed through the demo by pressing the ‘Next’ button on the RViz window when a prompt appears in your active terminal

The demo ends when the robot has successfully picked and placed all objects into respective dropboxes (though sometimes the robot gets excited and throws objects across the room!)

Close all active terminal windows using **ctrl+c** before restarting the demo.

You can launch the project scenario like this:
```sh
$ roslaunch pr2_robot pick_place_project.launch
```
# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Extract features and train an SVM model on new objects (see `pick_list_*.yaml` in `/pr2_robot/config/` for the list of models you'll be trying to identify). 
2. Write a ROS node and subscribe to `/pr2/world/points` topic. This topic contains noisy point cloud data that you must work with.
3. Use filtering and RANSAC plane fitting to isolate the objects of interest from the rest of the scene.
4. Apply Euclidean clustering to create separate clusters for individual items.
5. Perform object recognition on these objects and assign them labels (markers in RViz).
6. Calculate the centroid (average in x, y and z) of the set of points belonging to that each object.
7. Create ROS messages containing the details of each object (name, pick_pose, etc.) and write these messages out to `.yaml` files, one for each of the 3 scenarios (`test1-3.world` in `/pr2_robot/worlds/`).  See the example `output.yaml` for details on what the output should look like.  
8. Submit a link to your GitHub repo for the project or the Python code for your perception pipeline and your output `.yaml` files (3 `.yaml` files, one for each test world).  You must have correctly identified 100% of objects from `pick_list_1.yaml` for `test1.world`, 80% of items from `pick_list_2.yaml` for `test2.world` and 75% of items from `pick_list_3.yaml` in `test3.world`.
9. Congratulations!  Your Done!

# Extra Challenges: Complete the Pick & Place
7. To create a collision map, publish a point cloud to the `/pr2/3d_map/points` topic and make sure you change the `point_cloud_topic` to `/pr2/3d_map/points` in `sensors.yaml` in the `/pr2_robot/config/` directory. This topic is read by Moveit!, which uses this point cloud input to generate a collision map, allowing the robot to plan its trajectory.  Keep in mind that later when you go to pick up an object, you must first remove it from this point cloud so it is removed from the collision map!
8. Rotate the robot to generate collision map of table sides. This can be accomplished by publishing joint angle value(in radians) to `/pr2/world_joint_controller/command`
9. Rotate the robot back to its original state.
10. Create a ROS Client for the “pick_place_routine” rosservice.  In the required steps above, you already created the messages you need to use this service. Checkout the [PickPlace.srv](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Perception-Project/tree/master/pr2_robot/srv) file to find out what arguments you must pass to this service.
11. If everything was done correctly, when you pass the appropriate messages to the `pick_place_routine` service, the selected arm will perform pick and place operation and display trajectory in the RViz window
12. Place all the objects from your pick list in their respective dropoff box and you have completed the challenge!
13. Looking for a bigger challenge?  Load up the `challenge.world` scenario and see if you can get your perception pipeline working there!

Note: The robot is a bit moody at times and might leave objects on the table or fling them across the room :D
As long as your pipeline performs succesful recognition, your project will be considered successful even if the robot feels otherwise!
