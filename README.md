# 3D Perception Project [![Udacity - Robotics NanoDegree Program](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Extra+Images/RoboND_flag.png)](https://www.udacity.com/robotics)


using pr2 robot which has RGB-D camera to perceive it's surrounding to pick specific object by defining it and place it in another specific place depending on the object itself, by performing analysis on the received data which has noise and distortion, by applying the filtering and segmentation techniques then object recognition  and pose estimation to be able to tell the robot the position and orientation for each object.


## about PR2
The PR2 is one of the most advanced research robots ever built. Its powerful hardware and software systems let it do things like clean up tables, fold towels, and fetch you drinks from the fridge.

## 4- Statistical Outlier Filtering
While calibration takes care of distortion, noise due to external factors like dust in the environment, humidity in the air, or presence of various light sources lead to sparse outliers which corrupt the results even more.

Such outliers lead to complications in the estimation of point cloud characteristics like curvature, gradients, etc. leading to erroneous values, which in turn might cause failures at various stages in our perception pipeline.

One of the filtering techniques used to remove such outliers is to perform a statistical analysis in the neighborhood of each point, and remove those points which do not meet a certain criteria. PCL’s StatisticalOutlierRemoval filter is an example of one such filtering technique. For each point in the point cloud, it computes the distance to all of its neighbors, and then calculates a mean distance.

```python
    # due to external factors like dust in the environment we apply Outlier Removal Filter
    # taking the number of neighboring points = 4 & threshold scale factor = .00001
    outlier_filter = cloud_filtered.make_statistical_outlier_filter()
    outlier_filter.set_mean_k(4)
    x = 0.00001
    outlier_filter.set_std_dev_mul_thresh(x)
    cloud_filtered = outlier_filter.filter()
```

big difference !!


## 5- Voxel Grid Downsampling
RGB-D cameras provide feature rich and particularly dense point clouds, meaning, more points are packed in per unit volume than, for example, a Lidar point cloud. Running computation on a full resolution point cloud can be slow and may not yield any improvement on results obtained using a more sparsely sampled point cloud.

So, in many cases, it is advantageous to downsample the data. In particular, you are going to use a VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter to derive a point cloud that has fewer points but should still do a good job of representing the input point cloud as a whole.
```python
    # using VoxelGrid Downsampling Filter to derive a point cloud that has fewer points
    # Creating a VoxelGrid filter object taking the leaf-size = .01
    vox = cloud_filtered.make_voxel_grid_filter()
    LEAF_SIZE = 0.01
    vox.set_leaf_size(LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE, LEAF_SIZE)
    cloud_filtered = vox.filter()
```

#### the cloud after Voxel Grid Downsampling

![try2](https://github.com/mohamedsayedantar/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/images/try3.jpg)
done! : low points per unit volume


## 6- PassThrough Filter 

The Pass Through Filter works much like a cropping tool, which allows you to crop any given 3D point cloud by specifying an axis with cut-off values along that axis. The region you allow to pass through, is often referred to as region of interest.

Applying a Pass Through filter along z axis (the height with respect to the ground) to our tabletop scene in the range 0.61 to 1.1

```python
    passthrough = cloud_filtered.make_passthrough_filter()
    filter_axis = 'z'
    passthrough.set_filter_field_name(filter_axis)
    axis_min = 0.61
    axis_max = 1.1
    passthrough.set_filter_limits(axis_min, axis_max)
    cloud_filtered = passthrough.filter()
```

Applying a Pass Through filter along y axis (for horizontal axis) to our tabletop scene in the range -0.45 to 0.45

```python
    passthrough = cloud_filtered.make_passthrough_filter()
    filter_axis = 'y'
    passthrough.set_filter_field_name(filter_axis)
    axis_min = -0.45
    axis_max = 0.45
    passthrough.set_filter_limits(axis_min, axis_max)
    cloud_filtered = passthrough.filter()
```

#### the cloud after PassThrough Filter

![try2](https://github.com/mohamedsayedantar/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/images/try4.jpg)
done! : the region has been specified


## 7- RANSAC Plane Segmentation

to remove the table itself from the scene. a popular technique known as Random Sample Consensus or "RANSAC". RANSAC is an algorithm, that can be used to identify points in the dataset that belong to a particular model.

The RANSAC algorithm assumes that all of the data in a dataset is composed of both inliers and outliers, where inliers can be defined by a particular model with a specific set of parameters, while outliers do not fit that model and hence can be discarded. Like in the example below, we can extract the outliners that are not good fits for the model.

If there is a prior knowledge of a certain shape being present in a given data set, we can use RANSAC to estimate what pieces of the point cloud set belong to that shape by assuming a particular model.

```python
    # using The RANSAC algorithm to remove the table from the scene
    # by Creating the segmentation object and Setting the model
    # setting the max_distance then extracting the inliers and outliers
    seg = cloud_filtered.make_segmenter()
    seg.set_model_type(pcl.SACMODEL_PLANE)
    seg.set_method_type(pcl.SAC_RANSAC)
    max_distance =0.01
    seg.set_distance_threshold(max_distance)
    inliers, coefficients = seg.segment()

    # Extract inliers and outliers
    extracted_table = cloud_filtered.extract(inliers, negative=False)
    extracted_objects = cloud_filtered.extract(inliers, negative=True)
```

done! : object and table have been extracted


## 8- Euclidean Clustering "DBSCAN Algorithm"

DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. 

The DBSCAN algorithm creates clusters by grouping data points that are within some threshold distance from the nearest other point in the data.

The DBSCAN Algorithm is sometimes also called “Euclidean Clustering”, because the decision of whether to place a point in a particular cluster is based upon the “Euclidean distance” between that point and other cluster members.

```python
    # using a PCL library to perform a DBSCAN cluster search
    # first convert XYZRGB to XYZ then Create a cluster extraction object
    # then by Settin the tolerances for distance threshold, minimum and maximum cluster size
    # then Search the k-d tree for clusters and Extract indices for each of the discovered clusters
    white_cloud = XYZRGB_to_XYZ(extracted_objects)
    tree = white_cloud.make_kdtree()
    ec = white_cloud.make_EuclideanClusterExtraction()
    ec.set_ClusterTolerance(0.015)
    ec.set_MinClusterSize(1)
    ec.set_MaxClusterSize(50000)
    ec.set_SearchMethod(tree)
    cluster_indices = ec.Extract()
```

visualize the results in RViz! by creating another point cloud of type PointCloud_PointXYZRGB.

```python
    # final step is to visualize the results in RViz!
    # by creating another point cloud of type PointCloud_PointXYZRGB
    cluster_color = get_color_list(len(cluster_indices))
    color_cluster_point_list = []
    for j, indices in enumerate(cluster_indices):
        for i, indice in enumerate(indices):
            color_cluster_point_list.append([white_cloud[indice][0],
                                            white_cloud[indice][1],
                                            white_cloud[indice][2],
                                             rgb_to_float(cluster_color[j])])
    cluster_cloud = pcl.PointCloud_PointXYZRGB()
    cluster_cloud.from_list(color_cluster_point_list)
```

    ros_cloud_objects = pcl_to_ros(extracted_objects)
    ros_cloud_table = pcl_to_ros(extracted_table)
```

## 9- Color Histograms
a color histogram is a representation of the distribution of colors in an image. For digital images, a color histogram represents the number of pixels that have colors in each of a fixed list of color ranges, that span the image's color space, the set of all possible colors.

#### copmute the color histogram

```python
def compute_color_histograms(cloud, using_hsv=False):

    # Compute histograms for the clusters
    point_colors_list = []

    # Step through each point in the point cloud
    for point in pc2.read_points(cloud, skip_nans=True):
        rgb_list = float_to_rgb(point[3])
        if using_hsv:
            point_colors_list.append(rgb_to_hsv(rgb_list) * 255)
        else:
            point_colors_list.append(rgb_list)

    # Populate lists with color values
    channel_1_vals = []
    channel_2_vals = []
    channel_3_vals = []

    for color in point_colors_list:
        channel_1_vals.append(color[0])
        channel_2_vals.append(color[1])
        channel_3_vals.append(color[2])

    L1_hist = np.histogram(channel_1_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))
    L2_hist = np.histogram(channel_2_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))
    L3_hist = np.histogram(channel_3_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))

    hist_features = np.concatenate((L1_hist[0], L2_hist[0], L3_hist[0])).astype(np.float64)
    norm_features = hist_features / np.sum(hist_features)

    return norm_features
```

## 10- normal histograms
a normal histogram is a representation of the distribution of normals to the shape in an image

```python
def compute_normal_histograms(normal_cloud):
    norm_x_vals = []
    norm_y_vals = []
    norm_z_vals = []

    for norm_component in pc2.read_points(normal_cloud,
                                          field_names = ('normal_x', 'normal_y', 'normal_z'),
                                          skip_nans=True):
        norm_x_vals.append(norm_component[0])
        norm_y_vals.append(norm_component[1])
        norm_z_vals.append(norm_component[2])

    # TODO: Compute histograms of normal values (just like with color)
    S1_hist = np.histogram(norm_z_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))
    S2_hist = np.histogram(norm_z_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))
    S3_hist = np.histogram(norm_z_vals, bins=32, range=(0, 256))

    hist_features = np.concatenate((S1_hist[0], S2_hist[0], S3_hist[0])).astype(np.float64)
    normed_features = hist_features / np.sum(hist_features)

## 11- object recognition "SVM"

Support Vector Machine or "SVM" is just a funny name for a particular supervised machine learning algorithm that allows you to characterize the parameter space of your dataset into discrete classes.

SVMs work by applying an iterative method to a training dataset, where each item in the training set is characterized by a feature vector and a label. 

```python

    # second part :- object recognition

    for index, pts_list in enumerate(cluster_indices):

        # Grab the points for the cluster
        pcl_cluster = extracted_objects.extract(pts_list)

        # convert the cluster from pcl to ROS
        ros_cluster = pcl_to_ros(pcl_cluster)

        # Extract histogram features
        color_hists = compute_color_histograms(ros_cluster, using_hsv=True)
        normals = get_normals(ros_cluster)
        normal_hists = compute_normal_histograms(normals)
        feature = np.concatenate((color_hists, normal_hists))

        # Make the prediction, retrieve the label for the result
        # and add it to detected_objects_labels list
        prediction = clf.predict(scaler.transform(feature.reshape(1,-1)))
        label = encoder.inverse_transform(prediction)[0]
        detected_objects_labels.append(label)

        # Publish a label into RViz
        label_pos = list(white_cloud[pts_list[0]])
        label_pos[2] += .2
        object_markers_pub.publish(make_label(label,label_pos, index))

        # Add the detected object to the list of detected objects.
        do = DetectedObject()
        do.label = label
        do.cloud = ros_cluster
        detected_objects.append(do)

## 12- PR2_Mover function

#### first we have to  Initialize the variables

```python
    object_name = String()
    test_scene_num = Int32()
    pick_pose = Pose()
    place_pose = Pose()
    arm_name = String()
```

#### then we have to Get/Read parameters and loop through each point and compute it's centroid

```python
    # Get/Read parameters
    object_list_param = rospy.get_param('/object_list')
    dropbox_param = rospy.get_param('/dropbox')
    test_scene_num.data = 2
    yaml_dict_list = []
    labels = []
    centroids = []

    # access the (x, y, z) coordinates of each point and compute the centroid
    for object in object_list:
        labels.append(object.label)
        points_arr = ros_to_pcl(object.cloud).to_array()
        centroids.append(np.mean(points_arr, axis=0)[:3])
```

#### then we have to loop through the pick list to calc the pick pose and the place pose  then we have to Create a list of dictionaries for yaml.

```python
    for i in range(0, len(object_list_param)):
        # get the object name and group from object list
        object_name.data = object_list_param[i]['name']
        object_group = object_list_param[i]['group']

        try:
            index = labels.index(object_name.data)
        except ValueError:
            print "Object not detected: %s" %object_name.data
            continue

        # get the pick pose and place pose
        pick_pose.position.x = np.asscalar(centroids[index][0])
        pick_pose.position.y = np.asscalar(centroids[index][1])
        pick_pose.position.z = np.asscalar(centroids[index][2])

        selected_dic = [element for element in dropbox_param if element['group'] == object_group][0]
        position = selected_dic.get('position')
        place_pose.position.x = position[0]
        place_pose.position.y = position[1]
        place_pose.position.z = position[2]

        # to know wich arm to be used
        selected_dic = [element for element in dropbox_param if element['group'] == object_group][0]
        arm_name.data = selected_dic.get('name')

        # Create a list of dictionaries for yaml
        yaml_dict = make_yaml_dict(test_scene_num, arm_name, object_name, pick_pose, place_pose)
        yaml_dict_list.append(yaml_dict)

        # Wait for 'pick_place_routine' service to come up
        rospy.wait_for_service('pick_place_routine')
        try:
            pick_place_routine = rospy.ServiceProxy('pick_place_routine', PickPlace)
            resp = pick_place_routine(test_scene_num, object_name, arm_name, pick_pose, place_pose)
            print ("Response: ",resp.success)
        except rospy.ServiceException, e:
            print "Service call failed: %s"%e
```

#### eventually extract the output in yaml format

```python
    # get the output in yaml format
    yaml_filename = 'output_'+str(test_scene_num.data)+'.yaml'
    send_to_yaml(yaml_filename, yaml_dict_list)
```


## 13- Creating ROS Node, Subscribers, and Publishers

#### first we have to intialize our node 

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # ROS node initialization
    rospy.init_node('clustering', anonymous=True)
```

#### then we have to Create Subscribers and Publishers

```python
    # Create Subscribers
    pcl_sub = rospy.Subscriber("/pr2/world/points", pc2.PointCloud2, pcl_callback, queue_size=1)

    # Create Publishers
    pcl_objects_pub = rospy.Publisher("/pcl_objects", PointCloud2, queue_size=1)
    pcl_table_pub = rospy.Publisher("/pcl_table", PointCloud2, queue_size=1)
    pcl_cluster_pub = rospy.Publisher("/pcl_cluster", PointCloud2, queue_size=1)
    object_markers_pub   = rospy.Publisher("/object_markers", Marker, queue_size=1)
    detected_objects_pub = rospy.Publisher("/detected_objects", DetectedObjectsArray, queue_size=1)
```

#### now we cat load the model data from the disc, and as the node is still active we will spin our code.

```python
    # Load Model From disk
    model = pickle.load(open('model.sav', 'rb'))
    clf = model['classifier']
    encoder = LabelEncoder()
    encoder.classes_ = model['classes']
    scaler = model['scaler']

    # Initialize color_list
    get_color_list.color_list = []

    # Spin while node is not shutdown
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        rospy.spin()
```


## 14- environment setup and running

For this setup, catkin_ws is the name of active ROS Workspace, if your workspace name is different, change the commands accordingly
If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

Now that you have a workspace, clone or download this repo into the src directory of your workspace:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/mohamedsayedantar/RoboND-Perception-Project.get
```
#### Note: If you have the Kinematics Pick and Place project in the same ROS Workspace as this project, please remove the 'gazebo_grasp_plugin' directory from the `RoboND-Perception-Project/` directory otherwise ignore this note. 

Now install missing dependencies using rosdep install:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
```
Build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```
Add following to your .bashrc file
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
```

If you haven’t already, following line can be added to your .bashrc to auto-source all new terminals
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

To run the project:
```sh
$ roslaunch pr2_robot pick_place_project.launch
```

and in another terminal:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Perception-Project/pr2_robot/scripts
$ chmod u+x project_template.py
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosrun pr2_robot project_template.py
```

#### to generate the model.sav file for each group of objects "for each world"
you can change the objects in `capture_features.py` file in `sensor_stick/scripts` with the objects for each world.

##### these objects can be found in `pick_list_*.yaml` files in `/pr2_robot/config/` now we can Generate the Features:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ roslaunch sensor_stick training.launch
```

##### then in another terminal
```sh
$ rosrun sensor_stick capture_features.py
```

#### after finishing we able to generate our model.sav file using:
```sh
$ rosrun sensor_stick train_svm.py
```

##### to change the world itself in Gazebo and RViz we can change `pick_list_1` and `test1` in `pick_place_project.launch` file in the `/pr2_robot/config` directory to choose any world from the 3 worlds

```
    <!--TODO:Change the world name to load different tabletop setup-->
    <arg name="world_name" value="$(find pr2_robot)/worlds/test1.world"/>
```
```
    <!--TODO:Change the list name based on the scene you have loaded-->
    <rosparam command="load" file="$(find pr2_robot)/config/pick_list_1.yaml"/>
```

## Notes

### Note 1:
in the world 3 after running `rosrun pr2_robot project_template.py` this error will occur:
![error](https://github.com/mohamedsayedantar/RoboND-Perception-Project/blob/master/images/error.jpg)

to solve this error go to `features.py` file in `sensor_stick/src/sensor_stick` to modify the `np.histogram` method in `compute_normal_histograms` function by changing the range from `range=(0, 256)` to `range=(-1, 1)` to solve this error.

### Note 2:
the 3 worlds `model.sav` files is existed in the `RoboND-Perception-Project` directory as `model_*.sav`
